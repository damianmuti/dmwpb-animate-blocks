# [DMWPB] Animate Blocks

This plugin extends <strong>[group, columns, column, paragraph, image, heading, buttons, button]</strong> Gutenberg core blocks to enable reveal animations.

## F.A.Q

> Does this plugin work with any Wordpress installation?

This plugin extends Wordpress core blocks, therefore **requires Gutenberg** up and running to work.

<br>

> Does this plugin use Javascript for the animations?

No. Javascript is used to add/remove/toggle classes depending on the settings, but animations are css-only.

<br>

> What happens if I uninstall the plugin?

The plugin uses server-side rendering for each of the animated blocks, so there won't be any issues upon deactivating it.
