2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with any Wordpress installation? =

This plugin extends Wordpress core blocks, therefore **requires Gutenberg** up and running to work.

= Does this plugin use Javascript for the animations? =

No. Javascript is used to add/remove/toggle classes depending on the settings, but animations are css-only.

= What happens if I uninstall the plugin?

The plugin uses server-side rendering for each of the animated blocks, so there won't be any issues upon deactivating it.
